## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One major challenge I faced was **structuring the layout with CSS Grid**. Initially, the content wouldnâ€™t stack properly when switching to mobile view. The problem was that I **forgot to define `grid-template-columns: 1fr;`** in my media query. After identifying this issue, I corrected it by applying the following:

/* ```css*/
@media (max-width: 430px) {
    .mc {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* This fixed the issue */
    }
}*/

## Continued development

For future projects, I want to:

- Improve my use of **CSS Grid** for better layout structuring.
- Experiment with **CSS animations** to enhance UI interactivity.
- Get more comfortable using **CSS media queries** to handle responsiveness efficiently.

## Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) - Helped me understand how to structure grid layouts correctly.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Provided great visual explanations of grid behavior.
